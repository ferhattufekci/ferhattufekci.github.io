            The essence of requirements engineering is to clarify requirements,
            the set of information shared by all stakeholders (analysis, UI/UX,
            development, test and POC teams, and the end-user).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the requirements are unclear, they can be open to
            misinterpretation. A misunderstood requirement may lead to costly
            errors.
          </p>
          <p>So, how can we write requirements effectively?</p>

          <h4 class="text-bold">1.Avoid Ambiguous Expressions</h4>
          <p>
            Avoid phrases that could be interpreted differently by different
            people. Ensure that everyone understands the same thing when they
            read the requirements.
          </p>
          <p>For instance, in the statement:</p>
          <ul class="tags">
            <li>
              <a>The user will be able to easily record purchasing methods.</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            words like "easily," "normally," or "efficiently," which are
            subjective and lack precision, should be avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure consistency, use uniform terminology while writing
            requirements. Minimize the use of jargon or specialized terms. If
            such terms must be used, define them in the glossary section of your
            document to prevent any confusion.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-bold">2.Structure and Atomization</h4>
          <p>
            Ensure that requirements are written in a structured format,
            preferably as bullet points, and are atomic.
          </p>
          <p>For Example:</p>
          <ul class="tags">
            <li>
              <a
                >CompanyAbbreviation-ProjectAbbreviation-RequirementType(SRS or
                SSS)-UniqueRequirementNumber: Relevant SCC (Software
                Configuration Component), Relevant SCU (Software Configuration
                Unit), requirement.</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            FRHT-FOO-SRS-740070: The Bar SCE, Baz SCU will allow the user to
            query purchasing methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            To maintain atomization, avoid using conjunctions like "or" or "and"
            in a requirement statement. These often indicate multiple tasks
            within a single requirement. Focus each requirement on a single task
            by eliminating such connecting words.
          </p>

            3.The Requirement Expresses The Entire Work To Be Done
          </h4>
          <p>
            A requirement should comprehensively address the scope of the task.
            To achieve this, it is essential to answer the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In what conditions will it be used?</li>
            <li>When will it be executed?</li>
            <li>Who or what (person/system) will perform the task?</li>
            <li>What action or operation will be performed?</li>
            <li>
              What are the constraints on the affected person/object in specific
              situations?
            </li>
            <li>
              Under what conditions will the requirement not be applicable?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to these points, ensure that the requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Align with the expectations of the end user while considering the
              interests of the company.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid conflicts with the expectations of legal departments or
              other organizational units.
            </li>
            <li>
              Are designed to meet the user’s needs without contradicting
              corporate goals or guidelines.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example Requirement:</p>

            4.Maintain Consistency and Group Similar Requirements
          </h4>
          <p>
            We pay attention to grouping the requirements that describe the same
            work so that development and testing activities can be carried out
            easily in a way to covers 100% of the requirements, and if the
            end-user requests changes when the developed and tested product is
            presented to the end user if the end-user requests changes, we pay
            attention to grouping the requirements that describe the same work
            so that the engineering/contract change proposals that are deemed
            appropriate as a result of the analysis and analysis of the change
            request can be made easily and accurately.

          <p>
            In the event of contradictions, it is critical to resolve the
            contradictions in order to prevent the development of faulty
            products and avoid unnecessary costs. In order to resolve
            contradictions, we record the meetings and e-mail correspondence
            with the end user and associate them with the relevant
            addition/update/deletion requirement in the engineering/contract
            change proposal document to be written, so that we can see in which
            meeting or e-mail correspondence the end user stated his/her need or
            change request, By specifying which specification item I am basing
            the addition/update/deletion engineering/contract change proposals
            that will occur as a result of this request, we pay attention not to
            write a requirement that will take away from the functionality that
            the software will provide, not to write a requirement that will
            bring additional cost, and to ensure that when a requirement is
            looked at later, it is traceable why this requirement exists.

          <h4 class="text-bold">6.Prioritization of Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            It is essential to prioritize requirements and specify which ones
            should be developed first. This ensures the team focuses initially
            on mandatory requirements and subsequently on “nice-to-have”
            features.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the techniques we use to prioritize requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Grouping or Sorting:</u> This approach, you can assign a
              ranking or priority indicator to various requirements. For
              example, you can assign priority values as high/medium/low or even
              numeric values.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Time Boxing/Budgeting:</u> This approach can be used when there
              are fixed timelines and budgets to achieve project milestones.
              This approach is based on the principle of launching an MVP or
              core product with the required features on time, rather than
              launching a product with all features at a later date.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Deliberation or Voting:</u> This approach involves building
              consensus among stakeholders and prioritizing requirements based
              on various votes or inputs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="text-bold">7.Verifiable and Testable Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            We make sure that the quality assurance or testing team can verify
            whether a requirement has been developed correctly.
          </p>
          <ol class="tags">
            <li><a>System screens should be user-friendly.</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We do not write statements in the requirements text that are not
            verifiable-testable, such as “user-friendly”. In addition, when
            writing requirements, we also specify how they will be verified and
            what the acceptance criteria will be.
          </p>
          <div class="ellipsis">. . .</div>
          <p>
            Finally, even if the requirement is written by paying attention to
            the above items, the end user may not have expressed the need
            correctly, or the team member who performed the analysis may not
            have understood the end user's need correctly. In order to prevent
            wrong product development and unnecessary development costs, it
            should be kept in mind that as the development of the requirements
            is completed, the verification process should be carried out on the
            intermediate product, i.e. checking whether the product is built in
            accordance with the design documents, standards, and specifications
            and whether it works without errors, and then validation by showing
            it to the end user, i.e. whether the product works in real-world
            conditions and in accordance with user expectations, and recording
            the additional requests of the end user, if any, should be
            progressed by shaking hands.
