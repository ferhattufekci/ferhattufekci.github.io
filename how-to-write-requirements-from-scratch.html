            The essence of requirements engineering is to clarify requirements,
            the set of information shared by all stakeholders (analysis, UI/UX,
            development, test and POC teams, and the end-user).
          </p>
          <p>
            So how do we write requirements from scratch, how do we clarify the
            requirements?

            The step where we get the requirements from the user, and there are
            2 basic ways to do that.

            We have a technical specification, statement of work, or OCD
            (Operational Concept Document) that describes what the user will do.
            When there are documents, the method by which we extract
            requirements from these documents is the Strip Method.
          </p>
          <p>So how do we apply this method?</p>
          <p>
            We read each statement in the document and decide if this is a
            requirement. These documents usually have a story dimension and a
            comment dimension; it should be like this, this is what it does
            here. By removing unnecessary details, we remove only the statements
            that are considered to be requirements. We add these statements to
            the draft requirement library we call requirement database; “this
            statement may be a requirement, write it to the requirement
            database. This statement cannot be a requirement, don't write it.”
            we do the strip operation. In the requirement database, we apply
            this method by adding the user's comments to our requirement
            database by marking that it is supporting text and not a
            requirement.

            To understand the user's expectations from the system, we ask
            questions to the user by looking at the systems they use, if they
            have any, seeing the manual work they do with the user in their own
            work environment, listening to their requests for improvement, and
            looking at the problems there if they have units such as a help
            desk. Usually, the user responds indirectly, we ask them to
            elaborate more. User A says something, user B says something, and
            there are blurred lines. We try to solve these. We make mockup
            designs to increase clarity. After confirming, we add the details we
            receive from the user into sentences and add them to our requirement
            database.

            They called the stage of analyzing our draft requirement database as
            Analyzing. They have formalized this too.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-bold">2.1.Decomposition</h5>
          <p>
            It is a program where we translate complex long statements in our
            requirement database into smaller stand-alone meaningful statements
            and create a The section where we create child requirements from the
            statement.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-bold">2.2.Deduplication of Repetitions</h5>
          <p>
            After the decomposition process, there is duplication in some
            statements. At this stage, we deduplicate the repeated requirements.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-bold">2.3.Clarification</h5>
          <p>
            After deduplicating repeated requirements, you may notice that some
            statements are not clear. During the clarification phase, we work on
            making these statements clear. If the requirement is obtained from
            the user, we clarify it with the user; if it is extracted from
            documents, we delve into the documents for further details to make
            it clear. If the source cannot be accessed, we clarify it by making
            assumptions with the Project Manager and Technical Manager. We also
            document the requirements that we clarify together.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-bold">2.4.Elimination</h5>
          <p>
            This is the stage where we derive a new requirement from an existing
            one. It is crucial to ensure that the derived requirement is not
            created arbitrarily. It must always be based on a document or
            another requirement. It should not be forgotten that a requirement
            without a clear relationship to another could lead to additional
            development costs for features the user did not request and cause
            delays in the project timeline.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-bold">2.5.Categorization</h5>
          <p>
            As the name suggests, this is the stage where we write the created
            requirements in a categorical form. Categorizing requirements is
            important to ensure easier consistency checks, opening tasks with
            100% coverage, facilitating development and test case preparation,
            tracking project metrics more easily through categorical attributes,
            and making project management more efficient.

          <div class="ellipsis">. . .</div>
          <p>
            After the analyzing phase, we have a refined draft requirement

            They call the stage of documenting the draft requirement database as
            Specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Requirements define the need of the user, the system. It does not
            define how to do it. If you are talking about a software object or a
            database in a requirement, you are doing wrong, these are how to do
            the job. The reason we don't put them in the requirement database is
            that they affect the solution. In Requirement, if I write “.... will
            allow you to save it by clicking the save button in the lower right
            corner.”, it will affect whether I put the button on the left side
            or somewhere else. When we write requirements, we focus only on the
            need. The customer may have design requirements, of course, we keep
            them separate. However, if there is no design requirement from the
            customer, we are only trying to define what we will do in the
            requirement, we do not include how we will do it in the definition.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-bold">Step 4 Validation</h4>
          <p>
            This is the stage where I validate the documented requirements with
            stakeholders. First, I validate with the software developer within
            the company to see if it can be done. Then, I validate with upper
            management.

            Afterward, we validate with the customer and establish the baseline,
            confirming that the system to be developed will meet these
            requirements. This way, we close uncontrolled changes. From this
            point on, any changes are made in a controlled manner, and we
            proceed with the process by writing Engineering Change Proposals
            (ECPs) and Contract Change Proposals (CCPs). (I plan to explain how
            to write ECPs and CCPs in a separate post.)

            Finally, it should not be forgotten that in order to prevent the
            development of the wrong product and unnecessary development costs,
            as the requirements are developed, verification is carried out on
            the intermediate products, i.e., checking whether the resulting
            product is built according to design documents, standards, and
            specifications and works without errors. Then, validation is
            performed by showing the product to the end user to ensure it works
            under real-world conditions and meets user expectations, and any
            additional requests from the end user are recorded. This process
            should proceed with mutual agreements.
